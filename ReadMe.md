# X-ray Image Classification Using Keras

This project demonstrates how to train a deep learning model for X-ray image classification using Keras. The task is to classify images into two categories: **NORMAL** and **PNEUMONIA**. The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images.

## Project Overview

- **Data:** Chest X-ray images divided into three categories: **train**, **validation**, and **test**.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using Keras.
- **Libraries Used:** Keras, TensorFlow, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install streamlit
