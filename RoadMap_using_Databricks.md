### **Implementation Roadmap using Databricks**
Databricks provides a **scalable and collaborative environment** for handling large-scale medical imaging datasets, training deep learning models, and deploying them efficiently.

#### **Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation**
✅ **Step 1: Data Acquisition**
- Obtain a dataset of labeled medical images (e.g., NIH Chest X-ray dataset, Kaggle’s RSNA Pneumonia dataset, or hospital-provided anonymized data).
- Store the raw images in **Azure Data Lake, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage** (Databricks integrates with all of these).
     
✅ **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
- Convert images to a standard format (e.g., resizing to 224x224 pixels for CNNs).
- Normalize pixel values for better model convergence.
- Augment images (rotation, contrast adjustments) to improve generalization.
- Use **Databricks MLflow** to log data transformations.

**Tools:** Databricks Notebooks, Apache Spark for distributed data processing, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch.

---

#### **Phase 2: Model Development**
✅ **Step 3: Model Selection & Training**
- Choose a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, or DenseNet) and fine-tune it.
- Train the model using **Databricks GPU clusters** to accelerate processing.
- Use **Databricks AutoML** to experiment with different models.

✅ **Step 4: Model Evaluation**
- Test the model on validation datasets.
- Measure **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC**.
- Use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to explain model decisions.

**Tools:** TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, MLflow, Databricks AutoML.

---

#### **Phase 3: Deployment & Integration**
✅ **Step 5: Model Deployment**
- Register the best-performing model in **Databricks Model Registry**.
- Deploy the model as a **REST API endpoint** using **Databricks Serving**.

✅ **Step 6: Real-time Inference Pipeline**
- Build an ETL pipeline in Databricks to process new images from hospital PACS systems.
- Use **Apache Spark Streaming** for real-time inference.
- Send predictions and heatmaps (Grad-CAM visualization) to radiologists.

**Tools:** MLflow Model Registry, Databricks Serving, Apache Spark Streaming.

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring & Improvement**
✅ **Step 7: Model Performance Tracking**
- Use **Databricks MLflow** to track drift in model performance.
- Collect user feedback from radiologists to refine the model.

✅ **Step 8: Compliance & Security**
- Ensure compliance with **HIPAA, GDPR** for medical data handling.
- Implement **role-based access controls** in Databricks.

**Tools:** MLflow, Delta Lake for secure storage.
